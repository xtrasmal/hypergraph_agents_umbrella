# A2A Agent Web

Phoenix API for the A2A Agent system. Provides endpoints for agent workflows, story generation, summarization, and status/metrics.

## Agent Registry & Discovery

The A2A Agent Web app includes a robust, distributed agent registry and discovery system, enabling dynamic, plug-and-play agent participation across nodes and runtimes.

### `lib/a2a_agent_web_web/agent_registry.ex`

**Purpose:**
- Implements a distributed, in-memory registry for agent discovery and dynamic registration.
- Uses Phoenix.PubSub to synchronize agent presence across nodes.
- Persists registry state to disk for resilience.

**Key Features:**

- **Distributed Sync:** PubSub ensures all nodes converge on the same registry state.
- **Persistence:** Registry state is saved to disk and restored on startup.
- **Extensible:** New agent types, metadata, or protocols can be added by extending `AgentCard` and registration logic.

**Integration Points:**
- All agent presence/availability is managed here, enabling orchestrators and workflows to discover and utilize agents dynamically.
- External agents (e.g., Python) can participate by registering via the protocol.

**Amplification Opportunities:**
- Extend `AgentCard` with capabilities, health, or protocol info
- Add health checks and liveness monitoring
- Expose REST/gRPC endpoints for cross-language agent registration
- Add authentication/authorization for agent registration
